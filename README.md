# CompOS-Schedulers-project

In this project I was given the task to create different CPU scheduling algorithms and determine which scheduler program displays the best data
I focused on the main three algorithms that a CPU utilizes and coded them on python
The following are the scheduling algorithms that I covered:
    FCFS - First Come First Serve
    SJF - Shortest Job First
    MLFQ - Multilevel Feedback Queue
